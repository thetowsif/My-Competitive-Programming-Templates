# My-Competitive-Programming-Templates


### You have to do some stuff before straightly copying configs!
```
1. Copy "c_cp_custom.h" to "/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include/c++/v1/" (mac)
2. While coding with boilerplate/templates you have to create 'input.txt' and 'output.txt' on the same directory
```
